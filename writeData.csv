Admission to vit is a simple process. Vit conducts viteee exam in the month of april every year and based on the rank you will get a call for interview where you need to select the branch you are interested and pay the fee . Please select the hostel room at that time only because of huge crowd you may miss a AC room if you delay.,7.3

Great Placements. Great job opportunities. Restrictions for hostellers. Too much Restrictions on girls. Great Curriculum. Great alumni network. Great mess food quality. Great hostel accommodation. Expensive mess and hostel charges.,9.3

"Positive- Clean campus, vast exposure, complete academics, proper student welfare department,proper security and proper availability of everything. Negative- need to walk a lot from hostel to academic building and in-time in hostels.",8.8

"coming to the positives vit has a very good infrastructure, placements, fully flexible credit system and a lot of guidance to write research papers, sports facilities, hostel facilities etc while coming to the negatives the fees is bit high compared to other colleges.",9.5

Quite strict towards rules and policies. And separation between boys and girls. In-time system. There is a curdew timing i.e. students by that timd have to be inside the hostel block else they will be getting charged by a fine. And every mischief is charged by fine here and some has a big amt of fine,9.0

They have too much of Boys girls separation. Infact they appointed separate PDA guards to check in with this which i feel is pitiful. I also find difficulty on having such long walks to and fro college to hostel,7.0

"After passing out from my school in 12th, we have to give an entrance examination called VITEEE. Then when results are out we'll get to know our rank and one by one we'll be called. If we want to get admission, then we have to go. Then rank wise we will get to know how many seats are left in each branch. When our time comes we can choose which branch we want and can select to be a hostellers or Day boarder. Then we can pay our fees for the first year and our seat is confirmed.",8.0

Everything has its positive and negative content but in this case I think the positive does outweigh the negative . The best thing I found in ViT is FFCS and the worst are some of its strict rules and hostel and campus in time . Which is btw not that bad but needs some or more improvement,7.0

Write VITEEE exam. Be in the threshold limits of rank.Attend for counselling select the course if seats are available when your name pops up if not go for second optional course pay the admission fee and block the seat. Choose the type of hostel on the same day.,9.5

For my point of academics was good but hostel rules was very dominating. There was 7 pm time for entering girls in hostel and 6pm time for entering in campus for both boys and girls. U cannot go outside hostel in shorts or capree. Girls outing was banned on Saturday and Sunday.,8.3

As for positive remarks the only thing that comes to mind are the fests and the clubs along with the nice hostel environment which has no ragging and is very friendly. Negative remarks can be about the extreme entry time restrictions and strictness regarding alcohol consumption and girlfriends.,6.0

"First give the VITEEE Exam after your 12th boards and based on the marks scored you get ranks. Based on your rank you are called for a counselling in which you are given branch selection options, you can get a branch under different fee categories depending on your rank and seat availability. After you select your branch you have to pay some admission fees which is non-refundable. Later on if you're sure of joining the college then you can pay the entire tuition fees as well as hostel fees(mess +room).",6.0

Admission is based on entrance rank and based on rank the course counceling will be applicable and we can choose the course we have to pay 80%of fees at the time of council and book mess and hostel seat at the same time ,7.2

Positive is when comparing to other colleges the hostels and mess cost is little cheap and there is a fully flexible credit system like no other university have. IT Mean that the time table of our college is prepared by our selves. We can choose our own subject under the choice of our own faculty and under the choice of our own timings.,9.7

"positive is everything infrastructure facility ,accommodation, cultural fests,events and activities, hostel mess food , green campus with transportation facility and canteen ,labs with AC and sports facility of each type of sports and reputation of college,   negative- population is very high you should be talented enough to grab the opportunity and sometimes the fines are very high even for single mistakes means security and discipline is very tight",8.7

Vellore Institute of technology is overcrowded the postive thing in vellore Institute of technology is its beauty it's is expanded around 500 acres if land it has good water and hostel facilities in vellore Institute of technology ,9.2

I would say it is a very good college but the only problem is that it is overpopulated as the men's hostel only are 12 boys hostels so one can imagine how many students are there not only this if a student fails to perform in the college he is placed with all the bad students which doesn't motivates a child which is a bit harsh,8.0

Good college environment with excellent infrastructure and good teaching faculty.Good labs.Good hostel facilities with AC and NON AC rooms and good food depending on the region with veg and non veg dishes.,8.3

"The college management, both academics, and hostels are good and one can have a good time during their course completion.",8.0

"University is really well and good. One has to be blessed to study at VIT. There are some rules and restrictions for hostellers, otherwise no issues with the environment in VIT. For hostellers outing on weekends is only permitted till 6 pm, this is the main issue my hostel friends face.",9.2

The college is really good for  people who have talents and willing to show It out. At the same time u will also get spoiled if u choose the wrong path. People with talents have clubs and chapters to show their prowess. And the college can improve its hostel facilities ,7.7

"Our college Have good infrastructure structure bn well educated staff. But College have no hostel facility so I think they have think about it. Learnd New Things, good staff,good environment, good infrastructure n eduction system also too good",7.8

Good remarks are many as I have told in above all questions. Only thing is hostels are pretty strict and there is restrictions on timing you have to get in though Saturday is exception by an hour or so,7.3

Some hostel blocks should have changes of rooms that is the only bad remark of vit college,9.0

Well for a hostellers we have a compulsory Bio metric attandece in night .and the entry in hostel is only upto 9:00pm. Also if you want to go out for trips u have to file a leave request .which will be approved by your Procter after he talks to your parents . Bad for students good for parents. 							,8.3

Our college follows very strict rules for the hostelers and the management is pretty good. I am glad that I have studied in this college.   The infrastructure is really good and the college premises are neatly maintained with tress and plants around us.,10.0

"Management aims only at extorting good amount of money, and they support only studies Other activities are not promoted as much, only students have to go way overboard to get things done, even if it's as basic as hostel mess food.",8.8

Everything is good . Just that everything needs money and there are lots of fines and unnecessary strict rules in hostel.,8.8

"Campus Life: Brilliant, vibrant, beautiful extra-Curricular Activities: a whole lot and just awesome events: Right from cultural to technical to fun you get to taste everything students: From all parts of the country and some abroad students as well. Half of them are dudes or wanna be dudes Hostels: I think VIT has the best hostels, clean, spacious.. Wardens are friendly. Mess are messed up anyways. Sports: Lot of sports opportunity like Tennis, Cricket, Badminton, TT, Football, Track events, Basketball, etc. Although I never played them and I regret now. To sum up, the best thing about VIT is that everything is very good apart from Academics in terms of personality development, exposure an...",8.7

I got the rank and then the counselling was done for the branch and after which we get seats and hostel allocated. It was a one day process where you get the counselling done and also see the campus . you are called based on your rank for counselling and preference.,8.7

The college is very strict about the enrty time in your hostel blocks for both girls and boys. Drinking and smoking is strictly not allowed in the college campus. If caught strict actions are taken against students. The college always supports students for extracurricular activities.,9.0

"The university is like a small city inside the four walls. It has everything one needs from banks,  to shops,  to restaurants,  library,  park to keep you happy. the hostels are really good,  the city vellore is clean and is also managed by the university. the bus and commution is best. Train station is right outside the college.",10.0

"Vit is a place were you can make or break yourself. There are lot of activities going on in the campus were you can find your interest and prove your element. Pros: The best college with great infrastructure. Equal importance to sports and extra curricular activities with studies. Hygenic hostels and mess. Cost friendly for what a student achieves after getting into the college. The fest are energetic, lively and well balanced between entertainment and knowledge, managed by students. A vast library with numerous books and calm environment. Opportunity for students to take up projects/ college internship in foreign universities under foreign exchange program. Students credibility is well ackn...",9.5

"Every college has some good things and bad thinks. If I want to say about my college good things, it must be infrastructure, culturals, facilities, available of books, good developed labs, computer lab, hostel rooms, 8gp data per month I think so. If I wa",8.7

"The best remark is their duty towards students safety, the students are not allowed into campus after 9 pm. Management is so strict and they wont allow opposite genders to go into hostels. There is no bad remark about this College as it is top 4 th College in country and the management is the best.",8.5

"Everything thing about VIT vellore is very awesome. Campus, hostel, teachers, package. Everything thing is awesome, but only bad thing for me is the food :'( VIT should do something to improve this issue).",8.3

College is good. but the students in college are mostly from the rich families. So they comes with their habit of rude nature. It makes the hostel enviromnet bad. Overall it was nice experience in college with the friends.,7.5

College management is good in every field and the rules are strict inside hostel campus.Overall a good four years of experience.,8.8

"They should extend the in time for girls hostel and should have more freedom because college students are adults so it's not a good idea to have a control on them.And second thing, as VIT being a big institute, has a good no of students. Many people get l",8.5

"Good highlights best infrastructure, liberty to the students, best faculty, nice environment where we will get interest to live and study. Bad highlights are hostel in-time by 9:30 p.m and fines for each and every small mistakes.",8.8

Both, on and off campus housing options are available.&lt;&gt;
But most of the students prefer in campus as the hostels and mess food is way better than other colleges.&lt;&gt;

On the&amp;nbsp;campus, hostels are nice and good by hostel standards.&lt;&gt;
Food is surprisingly good but you can get bored after a certain point of time for which enough options are there in and around campus covering everything from Indian to Chinese food.&lt;&gt;

VIT is very good at education but the worst thing of VIT is hostels and food.&lt;&gt;
The food in VIT is too worst and many people wasting their money by spending only on the&amp;nbsp;food itself .&lt;&gt;
,3

The only point which lags in case of VIT is its housing and food.&lt;&gt;
Though&amp;nbsp;there are a large hostel campus and many rooms available on sharing as well as a personal basis, the rooms having common washrooms for a common floor are not so good.&lt;&gt;
Hygiene is a concern too and thus food isn\'t up to the mark.&lt;&gt;
,5

Housing and food are good.&lt;&gt;
Hygiene is well maintained.&lt;&gt;
Food is fresh and well served.&lt;&gt;
,8

Housing is good.&lt;&gt;
Among one of the best hostels provided but the food is not good.&lt;&gt;
They charge a lot as per the food quality.&lt;&gt;
,5

The food is good following the rebrand to Good Food, the idents changed to sequences involving the coming together of ingredients to events such as a picnic barbeque, a dinner party and a family Sunday roast.&lt;&gt;
The idents finish with an endboard featuring the circular Good Food logo in the centre of a screen with food imagery in the background, such as fish outlines, knife and fork or wine glasses.[10]&lt;&gt;

Good quality food is available but it gets boring with time.&lt;&gt;
Many fast food centres both on and off campus.&lt;&gt;
Hostels are very good but they have very strict rules.&lt;&gt;
,8

The food is not so great but it\'s quite edible.&lt;&gt;
There are wide varieties being served in and off campus.&lt;&gt;
The hostels are quite good but some rules are a bit irksome.&lt;&gt;
,8

Mess food is really good when you compare it to the food being served in the mess of other colleges.&lt;&gt;
,9

The hostel room allocating system is not appropriate.&lt;&gt;
There is a lot of politics, and the hostel food isn\'t great either.&lt;&gt;

There are total 17 boys hostels and 6 girls hostels. Hostels are spacious and well designed and attached with the&amp;nbsp;mess.&lt;&gt;

,5

Housing is excellent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;&gt;
The rules are very restrictive though and the food in the mess leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;&gt;
Off-campus options are plenty though and most are very pocket-friendly.&lt;&gt;

The hostels here are amazing! Mostly because they are new and they give a lot of amenities.&lt;&gt;
AC rooms are available and water shortage (which is a rampant issue here in Tamil Nadu) isn\'t an issue for the hostellers. Food is a primary issue here in the hostel. We\'ve had issues with the mess authorities.&lt;&gt;
An action does take place regularly, but as a hosteller incidents of the&amp;nbsp;food issues shouldn\'t be taking place at all.&lt;&gt;
I would give the hostel a 9/10. The food I\'d give 7/10. So on a whole, an 8 would suffice.&lt;&gt;
,8

The quality of food is not up to the mark on the campus but there is wide availability of tasty food around the college.&lt;&gt;
